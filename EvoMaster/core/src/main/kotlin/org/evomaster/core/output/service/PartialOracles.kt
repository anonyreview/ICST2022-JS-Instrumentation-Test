/**
 * [PartialOracles] are meant to be a way to handle different types of soft assertions/expectations (name may change in future)
 *
 * The idea is that any new type of expectation is a partial oracle (again, name may change, if anything more appropriate
 * emerges). For example, if a return object is specified in the Swagger for a given endpoint with a given status code,
 * then the object returned should have the same structure as the Swagger reference (see [responseStructure] below.
 *
 * They are "partial" because failing such a test is not necessarily indicative of a bug, as it could be some sort
 * or shortcut or something (and since REST semantics are not strictly enforced, it cannot be an assert). Nevertheless,
 * it would be a break with expected semantics and could be indicative of a fault or design problem.
 *
 * The [PartialOracles] would (in future) each receive their own variable to turn on or off, and only those selected
 * would be added to the code. So they should be independent from each other. The idea is that, either during generation
 * or during execution, the user can decide if certain partial oracles are of interest at the moment, and turn then
 * on or off as required.
