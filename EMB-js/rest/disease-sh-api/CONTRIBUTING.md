# Contributing to the NovelCOVID  API

Thanks for taking your time to consider contributing to the project!
In this file, you are going to find helpful tips on how to contribute your ideas!

We try to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug

- Discussing the current state of the code

- Submitting a fix

- Proposing new features


## Testing

We have a handful of unit tests to cover most of the APIs functionality.
Please always create tests for your code additions so we can easily see if your code works as expected.

## Submitting changes

* If you're unable to find an open issue, [open a new one](https://github.com/disease-sh/api/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title, a clear description of your idea or issue** and give as much relevant information as possible.
* Open  a new [GitHub Pull Request to API](https://github.com/disease-sh/api/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
